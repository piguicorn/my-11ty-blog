                    <p>(Mar. 2020 - May 2022)</p>

                    <p>I became “Top Rated” user on Upwork, working with different international and Agile teams. I also
                        learned how to communicate with clients and discuss design and development decisions with them.

                <h3>My story</h3>

                <p>When I wrote my first lines of HTML and CSS in 2017, I got drawn by its magic, and I haven’t stopped
                    loving them since then. I learned by myself for years and became comfortable with JavaScript
                    (although that didn’t stop me from learning other languages, such as PHP, Bash or Python).</p>

                <p>In 2020 I set the goal to find a junior position as a frontend developer. And against the odds, while
                    living a global pandemic, I started to get hired as a freelance UI developer to complete different
                    projects through Upwork.</p>

                <p>By the end of that year, I got the chance to work with e2y on the redesign of Duni’s websites, my
                    first project with a big impact. They valued my work enough to offer me a 35% pay rise after the
                    first month! This was a sign I was ready to land real jobs.</p>

                <p>In 2022 and after 2 years of experience working with different teams and clients, I could put an end
                    to my freelance journey and joined in99 as an employee for a Frontend Developer position, where I am
                    building forms and widgets that help clients to claim their rights in Spain.</p>
